An implementation of the [Signal Protocols][signal-docs] [X3DH][signal-x3dh] and [Double Ratchet][signal-double-ratchet].
Plus a simple straightforward usable E2E encryption library build on top, named Xochimilco.

For both implementation details and examples, take a look at the [documentation][go-doc].

Some background, the [lake Xochimilco][wiki-xochimilco] seems to be the last native habitat for the [axolotl][wiki-axolotl].
This salamander, also called _Mexican walking fish_, has incredibly self healing abilities.
For this reason, the Double Ratchet algorithm was initially named after this animal.
